### [Demo](http://github.hubspot.com/vex/docs/welcome/)

Vex is a modern dialog library which is highly configurable, easily stylable, and gets out of the way. You'll love vex because it's tiny (`<7kb`), has a clear and simple API, works on mobile devices, and can be customized to match your style in seconds.
